## ⚙️ Installation Steps for ESP32

1. **Connect Your ESP32**: Use a USB cable to connect your ESP32 board to your computer.
   
2. **Install Necessary Software**: 
   - You may need the Arduino IDE to upload the firmware. Download and install it from [Arduino's website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Open the Firmware in Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and extract the firmware package.
   - Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

4. **Configure Your Board**:
   - Go to `Tools > Board` and select your ESP32 model.
   - Change the COM port under `Tools > Port`, if necessary.

5. **Upload the Firmware**:
   - Click the right arrow button in Arduino IDE to upload the firmware to your ESP32.

### 📜 Running the Linux Script (Optional)

If you wish to use the Linux script to receive actions from the PTM216B:

1. **Open Terminal**: Access your terminal application.
   
2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.
   - Run `chmod +x your_script_name.sh` to make it executable.

3. **Start the Script**:
   - Run the script with `./your_script_name.sh`. Follow the on-screen instructions to set it up.

## 🌟 Features

- **Control Smart Lights**: Seamlessly manage your smart lighting using Enocean's PTM216B module.
- **Open Source**: The project is open source, allowing you to modify it as needed.
- **Linux Support**: The additional script makes it easy to integrate with Linux environments.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Use on different ESP32 boards for varied hardware setups.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

- **Unable to Connect to Device**: Ensure your ESP32 is connected correctly and the right COM port is selected in the Arduino IDE.
